        <h1>It's a Flippin' Camaro!</h1><!--Largest header-->
        <h2>A Sweet Ride</h2>
        <p>Many of you may have never heard of a Camaro. Kudos to all of you guys who do. For those of you who don't know what a Camaro is, I'm going to break it down for you.</p>
        <p>A Camaro is a sports car invented by Chevrolet. The first model for a Camaro was released in September of 1966. This car was nothing like the Camaros today, but was nonetheless an awesome car. That model was the XP-836, but it wasn't long until they released another model called the SS in 1967. The SS (Super Sport) model was much more popular, having a more modern look compared to other sports cars. Sports cars were quite new to the public, only having small and less fashionable cars. With the camaro introduced, the idea for sports cars increased, having Chevrolet, Ferrari, and Porche being the top-selling companies for sports cars, but that wasn’t until the 1970’s. From 1966-1971, Chevrolet was the only company that manufactured hypercars. After it was publicly introduced, approximately 700,000 first generation Camaros sold within a decent 3 to 4 years.</p>
