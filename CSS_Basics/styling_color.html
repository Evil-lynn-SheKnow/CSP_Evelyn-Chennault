        <h1 class="header_1">Car Paint Jobs</h1>
        <p class="p_1">Car paint jobs range in cost from around $300 to over $20,000, depending on the quality and complexity of the job. Basic paint jobs, often using single-stage enamel paint with minimal preparation, cost between $300 and $1,000. Mid-tier jobs, with better prep work, multiple coats, and a clear coat, typically range from $1,000 to $5,000. High-end, showroom-quality paint jobs, including extensive preparation, premium paint, and custom designs, can cost $5,000 to $20,000 or more.</p>
        <h2 class="header_2">Solid Colors</h2>
        <p class="p_2">Solid color car paint jobs are a straightforward and economical option for painting a vehicle, offering a uniform, non-sparkling finish. They are typically less expensive than metallic or pearlescent finishes and are often the standard color choice for many car manufacturers. Solid colors are known for their durability and ease of application, making them a popular choice for both professional and DIY paint jobs.</p>
        <h3 class="header_3"> Wraps</h3>
        <p class="p_3">Car wraps and paint jobs offer different approaches to changing a car's exterior color and style. Car wraps use vinyl film, offering customization, reversibility, and protection, but can be less durable than paint and might not last as long. Paint jobs, on the other hand, provide a seamless, lasting, and durable finish, but can be more expensive and time-consuming.</p>
