                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>Zion is best described as a landscape dominated by mountains, canyons, and rivers. It is famously known to be “carved” by the Virgin River. The colorful red rocks are what are classified as Navajo Sandstone. This rock is brittle in some cases and solid in others. Beautiful stripes and patterns make up the canyon, followed by several waterways and various kinds of wildlife. As a National Park, it is visited by people all over the world. Unlike other National Parks in Utah, Zion is a canyon with many narrow passages, which contributes to the hikes and tours given. Zion also has been rated for its really beautiful sunrises, sunsets, and viewable star formations.

        <div id="experience">
            <p>"As a family trip in April of 2025, my family and my cousins explored Zion National Park and all the wonders it had in store. We had driven to the main part of the Park, where everyone would go on shuttles to the Riverside walk. On another day, we climbed steep rock to reach the Sand Caves. The last day in Zion was our family walking the trail called the Belly of the Dragon, where little rock sculptures were found everywhere."
