        <h1>Computer Science Principles: Overview</h1>
        <p>There are many things to learn about computers, and where else better to learn them from than at Computer Science Principles. It is a class taught by Ms. LaRose at the Provo campus of UCAS (Utah County Academy of Sciences).</p>
        <p>In Computer Science Principles, or CSP as we students call it, we learn the main things of the computer. Some of these things are terms, parts of the computer, and much more. The biggest thing we are currently learning is the fundementals of HTML and CSS, which are for design layout of webpages and broswers, and such.</p>

        <h2>Computer Factors</h2>
        <p>In CSP, we learn about the following:</p>
        <ol>
            Coding language Python
            Coding language C
            HTML
            CSS
        </ol>
        <p>We have already learned about Python and C, so we are currently learning HTML and CSS. An important thing to note is that as much as it looks like it, HTML and CSS are not prgramming languages. Python and C are programming languages becuase they are meant for code, which is something we also make very clear in class. Later on in the class, we are introduced to JavaScript, which we are not learning until later in the year.</p>
